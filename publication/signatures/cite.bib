  abstract  = "AbstractModels for the second time-derivative of the geomagnetic
               field reveal prominent activity at high latitudes. Alternating
               patches of positive and negative geomagnetic acceleration
               propagate to the west at speeds that exceed nominal fluid
               velocities in the core. We show that waves are a viable
               interpretation of these observations. Magnetic Rossby waves
               produce a high-latitude response with suitable phase velocities.
               However, the spatial complexity of the prediction is not
               compatible with the observations. Our preferred interpretation
               involves zonal MAC waves. These waves can account for the
               observed geomagnetic field when a stratified layer exists at the
               top of the core. The required layer has a thickness in excess of
               100 km and a buoyancy frequency comparable to the rotation
               frequency. We anticipate a gradual reduction in the phase
               velocity over time, leading to a future change in the
               propagation direction.",
