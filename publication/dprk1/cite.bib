  abstract  = "Abstract The 3 September 2017 Mw 5.2 North Korean underground
               nuclear test (DPRK2017) is the largest man-made explosion with
               surface displacements observed by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
               and showed as much as 3.5 m of horizontal permanent deformation.
               Although regional distance waveform-based seismic moment tensor
               (MT) inversion methods successfully identify this event as an
               explosion, the inverted solutions do not fit the SAR
               displacement field well. To better constrain the source, we
               developed an MT source-type inversion method that incorporates
               surface ground deformation (accounting for free-surface
               topography), regional seismic waveforms, and first-motion
               polarities. We applied the source-type inversion over a grid of
               possible source locations to find the best-fitting location,
               depth, and point-source MT for the event. Our best-fitting MT
               solution achieves ∼70\% horizontal geodetic fit, ∼80\% waveform
               fit, and 100\% fit in the first-motion polarities. The joint
               inversion narrows the range of acceptable source types improving
               discrimination, and reduces the uncertainty in scalar moment and
               estimated yield. The method is transportable and can be applied
               to other types of events that may have measurable geodetic
               signals such as underground mine collapses and volcanic events.",
