 abstract = {Abstract Rapid growth of magnetic-field observations through
SWARM and other satellite missions motivate new approaches to
analyze it. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a method to
recover spatially coherent motion with a periodic time
dependence. We use this method to simultaneously analyze the
geomagnetic radial field and its secular variation from CHAOS-7
at high latitudes. A total of five modes are permitted by noise
levels in the observations. One mode represents a slowly
evolving background state, whereas the other four modes describe
a pair of waves; each wave is comprised of a complex DMD mode
and its complex conjugate. The waves have periods of T1 = 19.1
and T2 = 58.4 years and quality factors of Q1 = 11.0 and Q2 =
4.6, respectively. A 60-year wave is consistent with previous
predictions for zonal waves in a stratified fluid. The 20-year
wave is also consistent with previous reports at high latitudes,
although its nature is less clear.},
