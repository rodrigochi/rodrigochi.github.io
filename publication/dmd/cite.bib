  abstract  = "Abstract Rapid growth of magnetic-field observations through
               SWARM and other satellite missions motivate new approaches to
               analyze it. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a method to
               recover spatially coherent motion with a periodic time
               dependence. We use this method to simultaneously analyze the
               geomagnetic radial field and its secular variation from CHAOS-7
               at high latitudes. A total of five modes are permitted by noise
               levels in the observations. One mode represents a slowly
               evolving background state, whereas the other four modes describe
               a pair of waves; each wave is comprised of a complex DMD mode
               and its complex conjugate. The waves have periods of T1 = 19.1
               and T2 = 58.4 years and quality factors of Q1 = 11.0 and Q2 =
               4.6, respectively. A 60-year wave is consistent with previous
               predictions for zonal waves in a stratified fluid. The 20-year
               wave is also consistent with previous reports at high latitudes,
               although its nature is less clear.",
