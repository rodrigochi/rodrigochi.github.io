  abstract = "Abstract Satellite observations reveal short pulses in the second
              time derivative of the geomagnetic field. We seek to interpret
              these signals using complex empirical orthogonal functions
              (CEOFs). This methodology decomposes the signal into traveling
              waves, permitting estimates for the period, angular wave number,
              and phase velocity. We recover CEOFs from the CHAOS-6 model,
              focusing on three geographic regions with strong secular
              acceleration. Two regions are confined to the equator, while the
              third is located under Alaska. We find evidence for both eastward
              and westward traveling waves with periods between 7 and 20?years.
              There is also evidence for weaker standing waves with complex
              spatial patterns. Two of the three regions have waves that are
              compatible with predictions for waves in a stratified fluid. Our
              results yield estimates for the structure of fluid stratification
              at the top of the core.",
