  abstract  = "Abstract Rapid growth of magnetic-field observations through
               SWARM and other satellite missions motivate new approaches to
               analyze it. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a method to
               recover spatially coherent motion with a periodic time
               dependence. We use this method to simultaneously analyze the
               geomagnetic radial field and its secular variation from CHAOS-7
               at high latitudes. A total of five modes are permitted by noise
               levels in the observations. One mode represents a slowly
               evolving background state, whereas the other four modes describe
               a pair of waves; each wave is comprised of a complex DMD mode
               and its complex conjugate. The waves have periods of T1 = 19.1
               and T2 = 58.4 years and quality factors of Q1 = 11.0 and Q2 =
               4.6, respectively. A 60-year wave is consistent with previous
               predictions for zonal waves in a stratified fluid. The 20-year
               wave is also consistent with previous reports at high latitudes,
               although its nature is less clear.",

               patches of positive and negative geomagnetic acceleration
               propagate to the west at speeds that exceed nominal fluid
               velocities in the core. We show that waves are a viable
               interpretation of these observations. Magnetic Rossby waves
               produce a high-latitude response with suitable phase velocities.
               However, the spatial complexity of the prediction is not
               compatible with the observations. Our preferred interpretation
               involves zonal MAC waves. These waves can account for the
               observed geomagnetic field when a stratified layer exists at the
               top of the core. The required layer has a thickness in excess of
               100 km and a buoyancy frequency comparable to the rotation
               frequency. We anticipate a gradual reduction in the phase

  abstract  = "Abstract The 3 September 2017 Mw 5.2 North Korean underground
               nuclear test (DPRK2017) is the largest man-made explosion with
               surface displacements observed by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
               and showed as much as 3.5 m of horizontal permanent deformation.
               Although regional distance waveform-based seismic moment tensor
               (MT) inversion methods successfully identify this event as an
               explosion, the inverted solutions do not fit the SAR
               displacement field well. To better constrain the source, we
               developed an MT source-type inversion method that incorporates
               surface ground deformation (accounting for free-surface
               topography), regional seismic waveforms, and first-motion
               polarities. We applied the source-type inversion over a grid of
               possible source locations to find the best-fitting location,
               depth, and point-source MT for the event. Our best-fitting MT
               solution achieves ∼70\% horizontal geodetic fit, ∼80\% waveform
               fit, and 100\% fit in the first-motion polarities. The joint
               inversion narrows the range of acceptable source types improving
               discrimination, and reduces the uncertainty in scalar moment and
               estimated yield. The method is transportable and can be applied
               to other types of events that may have measurable geodetic
               signals such as underground mine collapses and volcanic events.",

              these signals using complex empirical orthogonal functions

              waves, permitting estimates for the period, angular wave number,

              acceleration. Two regions are confined to the equator, while the
              third is located under Alaska. We find evidence for both eastward
              and westward traveling waves with periods between 7 and 20?years.
              There is also evidence for weaker standing waves with complex
              spatial patterns. Two of the three regions have waves that are
              compatible with predictions for waves in a stratified fluid. Our
